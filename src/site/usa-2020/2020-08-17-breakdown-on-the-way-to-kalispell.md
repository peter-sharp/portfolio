Left 7th Ranch RV park and headed to Billings to get breakfast at McDonalds. Once there had breakfast and discussed the trip ahead. Had a saussage McGriddle, basically a saussage McMuffin with maple syrup infused pancakes intead of the muffin. Wasn't my thing.

A while later we stopped off at a rest area along the way. There was a patch of well-watered lawn and it was covered crickets. My son had fun chasing them.

Noticed a consistent flapping sound 23km away from Livingstone, pulled over and noticed one of the trailer wheels was partly stripped down to it's inner wall. We stopped, debated options, then sent the white Ford on ahead to fetch a new tire from Livingstone.
