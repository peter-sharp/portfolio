Stopped of at a Sinclairs that had a huge general store with lots of interesting snacks and nicknacks. Bought my son a toy pickup truck and got myself some pickled beans.

Called ahead to 7th Ranch RV park they had a vacancy so we stopped there for the night. It was the most well-kept RV park I'd seen in a while. A beautiful location too. Spotted some large frogs near the bathrooms one of my brothers in law picked one up and got peed on. Best laugh I had in a while.
